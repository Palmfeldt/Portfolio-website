        <h3>Windows-98-JS</h3>
        <p>
          As part of a assignment in a webprogramming course, we were tasked to
          create a window manager environment in clientside javascript. I decided to use vanilla JS. 
          In hindsight it would've probably been easier to use a framework like React or Angular. But hey, I learned a lot about JS.
        </p>
        <p>
          As such I created an environment that is supposed to look like Windows
          98. I found it rather fun to work with the assignment and as such spun
          it of as a public repository instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can find the entire project on my GitHub. There is also a hosted
          version on this website, it is one of the navigation bar.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the future, the project will probably not be named Alva edition (as
          that sounds like some sort of god complex).

        <h3>This website</h3>
        <p>
          Woah, isn't this meta? This website was made as a project in an old webdesign course.
          I later reworked it to be a bit more modern and to be more in line with my current skillset.
          The website uses plain HTML CSS and javascript. No libraries where used.
