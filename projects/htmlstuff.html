        <h3>Windows-98-JS</h3>
        <p>
          As part of a assignment in a webprogramming course, we were tasked to
          create a window manager environment in clientside javascript.
        </p>
        <p>
          As such I created an environment that is supposed to look like Windows
          98. I found it rather fun to work with the assignment and as such spun
          it of as a public repository instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can find the entire project on my GitHub. There is also a hosted
          version on this website, it is one of the navigation bar.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the future, the project will probably not be named Alva edition (as
          that sounds like some sort of god complex).

        <h3>Current status</h3>
        <p>
          As of right now there really isnt that much to talk about here. You
          can checkout the Current projects to see what I'm currently doing.
          Note that this website in it self is WIP which means that it will
          update in the future.
