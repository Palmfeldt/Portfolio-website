        <h3>Arduino Keyboard (Atmega32u4)</h3>
        <p>
          I've been working on a custom keyboard for a while now. It's based on
          the Arduino Leonardo (Atmega32u4) and uses custom made firmware made
          in arduino code (C++). The case and keycaps are 3D printed. The
          keyboard was designed to be a gamepad for Jubeat hence the 4x4 matrix.
          Cherry MX silent reds switches are used. You can find the code on my
          Github:

        <h3>3D printed majoras mask</h3>
        <p>
          While not really a hardware project, I did 3D print a majoras mask.
          It's a model found on thingiverse. I printed it on my modified Ender 3
          Pro. It took about 2 days to print.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used a 0.4mm nozzle and 0.2mm layer height. The filament is PLA. In
          hindsight I should've used a 0.6mm nozzle to speed things up.

        <h3>Replacing Macbook pro batteries are a pain</h3>
        <p>
          I was tasked to replace a Macbook Pro battery. It was a pain to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          The battery was glued to the case unlike the Macbook Air or any laptop
          for that matter...
        </p>
        <p>
          I had to use rubbing alcohol, I then had to pry the battery out with a
          spudger. Boy, that doest feel safe. I mean what if you tear the
          battery in the process? That would be a disaster.

        <h3>Raspberry Pi Zero webserver</h3>
        <p>
          In an attempt to run cheap webservers on anything I can find. I decided to try and run a webserver on a Raspberry Pi zero.
           The Pi zero is a small single board computer that is very cheap. It has a 1GHz single core CPU and 512MB of RAM. Not a lot to work with.
           But due to the low power requirements and the small form factor it is perfect for small projects such as this website. As such a Apache2 bare metal server is used for hosting this website.
           HTTP and HTTPS are the only things exposed to the internet. 
         </p>
         <p>
           A custom case was designed and printed for the Pi zero. The case is ziptied to a mobile phone power supply. In the future I'd like something with backup power.
         </p>
