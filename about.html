          I find aesthetic of old software somewhat charming and I get a lot of
          inspiration from old Windows operating systems.

          While I'm not that great at webprogramming, I find the subject
          interesting. The idea of having the ability of creating a fully fledged application that can be accessed on
          most devices seemed amazing. As such I currently work within fullstack programming.
          I've made this website from scratch. You can find this and other projects at my
          <a href="https://github.com/palmfeldt">GitHub repository</a>

          I would describe myself as having a "hacker mindset". I always try to
          find ways to bypass, break or hack things. And then there is the less
          fun part of reporting things.

          Feel free to check out some of the current projects I have. They can be
          found in the <a href="/projects.html">Project</a> part of the webpage
