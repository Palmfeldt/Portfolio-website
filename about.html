          <h3>Long bio</h3>
          <p>Hello, my name is Alva, I'm a programmer and hacker.</p>
          <p>I've always had a passion for PC stuff. I remember when I got my Core 2 Duo, Windows XP computer when I was
            a little kid, I was crazy about RuneScape, AdventureQuest and other flash games.</p>
          <p>After a while my mind begun to ponder, what if could hack any of my favorite games to give me more coins?
          </p>
          <p>And thus began my interest in how programs worked under the hood.</p>
          <p>I built my first computer when I was 14 years so I could play Minecraft without frame drops.</p>
          <p>Fast forward a few years and now I'm jumping between different subjects within IT. From hardware to
            software.</p>

          <p>When I was 18, I worked as a computer repair technician for my local school. That quickly expanded to repairing the school computers for the entire commune. There I was repairing
            Chromebooks, replacing busted screens, pencil lead shoved into the different connectors, replacing broken chassis and various broken components. </p>

          <p>Two years later I started studying Network Security at Linnaeus University. I learned a lot about networking, programming and IT-Sec.</p>

          <p>Today I am working at Combitech within their Weather systems division as a system engineer. I work with technologies such as Infrastructure as code with Ansible, RedHat Linux and web development in PHP, TypeScript & React.</p>
